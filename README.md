## How It Works
  The task scheduler in this application uses cron expressions to determine when tasks should be executed. Tasks can be scheduled to run at specific intervals, such as every minute, every hour, or daily at midnight. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the scheduler operates

 1. **Task Creation**
   - Users can create tasks by specifying a display name and a cron expression
   - The cron expression defines the schedule for when the task should be executed. Examples include */5 * * * * for every 5 minutes or 0 0 * * * for daily at midnight.

 2. **Task Execution**
   - Scheduled Tasks are managed using the node-cron library, which parses the cron expression and executes tasks according to the defined schedule.
   - Actions triggered by tasks might include sending emails or executing custom functions.
 3. **Logging**
   - Task Execution logs are created for each run, indicating whether the execution was successful or resulted in an error.
   - Logs include a timestamp, the task ID, status, and a message.
